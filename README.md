- 👋 Hi, I’m @ShaunF4469
- 👀 I’m interested in building, making, and creating. My kids and I love LEGO, STEM, and music!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python and app development.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing at the moment. I've worked as a PLC instructor in the automation 
-     business (Siemens/Rockwell) for over 10 years. Not a lot of inovation there.
- 📫 How to reach me: Here on GitHub and at shaun.fustin2@gmail.com
